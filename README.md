# eMC Setup Script
By Tiwonge Lwara

This script aims at setting up a site with eMC. The idea is to have one script that does all the steps an officer would do when setting up a site. Later this script (or parts of the script) will be added to a Pipeline to automate deploymnet.

The script can setup a new site or an existing one:

1. For a new site, the script clones relevant code into system dirs
2. For an existing site, the script simply checkouts the latest tag
